# Hoob4

Getting Hoobs4 running in a docker. Pretty directly stolen from [this](https://github.com/hoobs-org/HOOBS/issues/1774#issuecomment-1126948067) comment...

There is a config file in the `data` directory that you might want to sort or override (see `run.sh`).

It image is andybryson/hoobs on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/andybryson/hoobs)
